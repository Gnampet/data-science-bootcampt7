# Python Project Summary

## HW_Python1

In this project, I completed three assignments that provided valuable hands-on experience in Python programming:

### Assignment 1: Chatbot for Pizza Ordering
I created a chatbot for ordering pizza. 

### Assignment 2: Rock Scissors Paper Game
Developing the Rock Scissors Paper game. I use decision-making logic and user input validation, enhancing my understanding of control flow.

### Assignment 3: ATM Class Implementation
In this assignment, I created an ATM class that sharpened my skills in class design, and working with class methods.

Throughout HW_Python1, I honed my ability to create functions, design interactive applications, and employ 'if else' constructs for rule-based programming.

## HW_Python2

The second part of the Python project extended my programming with two more assignments and the final project:

### Assignment 1: API Data Retrieval and Cleaning
For this task, I utilized web scraping APIs to retrieve COVID-19 data updated 2023. I then cleaned the dataset and stored it in Google Drive. This prepared me to create a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau.

### Assignment 2: Machine Learning with Sklearn
Exploring machine learning, I imported various algorithms from Sklearn. I practiced Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, SGD Regressor, and Passive Aggressive Classifier, broadening my understanding of predictive modeling.

## Final Project: Sales Data Analysis
In the final project, I used pandas and NumPy to dig into sales data. This helps me with the ability to analyze and interpret real-world datasets using essential Python libraries.
